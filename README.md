# Net-UDAP

## Overview

Net::UDAP is a Perl module to configure the Logitech SqueezeBox Receiver (SBR) from a PC, i.e. without requiring a SqueezeBox Controller (SBC).

I currently develop on MacOS (14.5 Sonoma), but original developed and tested on linux (Fedora 8), Windows XP (ActiveState perl and cygwin).

## Donations

Net-UDAP is free software - you do not have to pay to use it.

However, if you find Net-UDAP useful, you might like to make a donation - I've got ~~four~~ five kids to support!
